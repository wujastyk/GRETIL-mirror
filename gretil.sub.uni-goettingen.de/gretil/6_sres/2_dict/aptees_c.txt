PUBLISHER'S PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.

In preparing this edition, extreme care has been taken to make a thorough revision of the book, the main features of which are:--
     (a) Over a thousand new words frequently occurring in the English literature but not given in the previous editions have now been added with their appropriate Sanskrit equivalents.
     (b) In some cases, Sanskrit equivalents of words in senses other than those given in the earlier editions have been supplied.
     (c) Words similar in form but different in sense, and also their derivatives were mixed u in the earlier editions to save space. But as this was found to interfere greatly with clearness and facility of reference they have now been separately given in some cases to remedy the inconvenience.
     (d) The feminine forms of adjectives ending in %<t n>% and %<s>% which are regularly formed by the simple addition of %<ã>% were given in the previous editions in the case of the first three letters, and then discontinued. They have now been deleted throughout.

In making these changes, the original plan of the learned author has been strictly followed.

These additions and alterations will be found to have considerably added to the usefulness of the book, and it is hoped that in its present form, it will be more helpful to the student world.


PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

When I prepared "The Student's Hand-Book of Progressive Exercises", Part II., I thought of adding to it a glossary of difficult words and expressions in the Exercises. When this was done, an idea occurred that the Glossary should be made to include all words of ordinary occurrence, such as are given in small School-Dictionaries. When the revision of the sheets thus written out commenced, and when they were put to a practical test, it was found that several words and expressions had still been left out. I, then, resolved to prepare an English-Sanskrit Dictionary as complete as possible, and the following pages are the result. The Dictionary has thus passed through different stages, and has assumed this form, far exceeding the limits which I had first assigned to it.

Much need not, I think, be said with regard to the necessity of a work like this. In these days of literary activity, when the attention of students is drawn more and more to the study of Sanskrit, it is necessary that all appliances should be ready before them to facilitate this study. There are one or two small Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, though not quite adequate to meet the wants of advanced students of Sanskrit, but there is no English-Sanskrit Dictionary such as will be within their easy reach. The Dictionaries of this description that I know of, are two in number:-one by Professor Monier Williams, and another by Mr. Anundoram Borooah of Calcutta. Both these Dictionaries, though valuable in themselves, are not accesible to the student, the prices being prohibitively high. But there are other considerations which make these works not quite adapted to his wants. Professor Monier Williams' Dictionary, having been compiled nearly 35 years ago, chiefly by inverting the then existing Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, is naturally open to the fault of being often not practical. As he says in the Preface to his Dictionary, he proceeded to translate Webster's Dictionary systematically into Sanskrit, omitting words, phrases &c. of which no classical equivalent could be found or suggested. The result has been that many of his synonyms appear more as coined words than classical expressions used by standard Sanskrit authors. With regard to words collected in Lexicons, such as Amarakosha, Medini, Sabdakalpadruma, there is no difficulty; but in the case of those words and expressions which can only be suggested by a careful study of the usage of the best authors, the work, in my humble opinion, falls short of one's expectations. Mr. Anundoram Borooah's work is eminently practical: it abounds with quotations from several standard authors; the renderings are generally happy, and the work has, at least, a classical appearance. The fondness for giving quotations has induced the writer to give several quotations for illustrating such words as %<gama iti tatra vada>% &c., of the meanings of which there is no doubt nor is any confirmation needed. But one great defect of his otherwise very useful work is that it gives too few equivalents. He has pursued the course of referring one word to another, but this is, in some cases, carried to such an extent, that when a word, as directed, is referred to another, that again is referred to some other word of a synonymous nature, which in its turn is referred to another till the reader returns to the original word, apparently without having his labours rewarded. A study of Mr. Borooah's work is a good treat for an advanced Sanskrit scholar, but will not, I believe, satisfy the student. From considerations like these I thought I should be doing some service to the Sanskrit reading public, if I compiled an English-Sanskrit Dictionary adapted to the wants of the student. The foregoing remarks are made not with the view of detracting from the high and acknowledged merits of the two works but solely to indicate the line I have followed, and the object I have had in compiling this work.

Some words are now necsesary as to the plan and scope of the Dictionary. When I resolved to make this Dictionary as complete as possible, consistently with its aim of being useful for the student, I took the latest edition of Webster's Complete Dictionary, and taking that as my basis, proceeded with the work of compilation. As I advanced, I found that several words, phrases and expressions and several senses of single words, could not be adeqately represented in Sanskrit, so as to appear like Sanskrit, either because the words &c. were purely technical and referred to specific ideas in subjects, such as Chemistry, Botany, Medicine, Psychology, Law, Engineering &c., or were such as had no corresponding ideas in Sanskrit and were peculiar to the English language. Words of this nature are numerous in Webste's Dictionary, and I have omitted them, including also obsolete and rare words or senses of words. Several words of obvious signification, 'such as those formed by the prefixes' 'in' 'mis' 'pre' 'un,' are also omitted, as they may be easily formed from their second member. But the general terms of all sciences have been included, and of technical terms such as could be duly represented by Sanskrit equivalents actually existing in the language of by short, wieldy new combinations of words have been inserted. Of this description are words like Telegram, Democrat, Society, Literature, Address (of a letter) and several other words which have a peeuliar sense in English and have to be translated by inventing equivalents. English. like many other languages, has so many expressions and idioms peculiar to itself, so many shades and nice distinctions of meaning, and so many new formations of words, progressing with the progress of the language, that it would be impossible to embrace them all in an English-Sanskrit Dictionary, even if it were the most comprehensive work, much more so, in a work designed principally for students. Take the words Line, Pass, Strong. Webster gives 21 senses under 'Line' '13 under' Pass (v. i.) 'and 20 under' Strong' Some of these are technical' and some are not different senses as such, but shades of meaning or particularities of use; most of which may be translated by the words given for. the general sense' (see the words)' I have not thought it desirable, like Professor Monier Williams, to insert words the English explanation of which has to be systematically translated, in order to give some idea of their meaning. 'Indian-rubber' is translated by %<atisthitisthàpakavi÷iùño bhàratade÷ãyavçkùaniryàsaþ;>% 'Shuttle cock' by %<laghugulikàvi÷eùaþ yo vinodàrthaü daüóàhato bhåtvà itastataþ prakùipyateþ>% and many others of this nature, which can be translated by %<vi÷eùaþ>% 'a kind of tree' flower, fruit' &c. Such words may be retained by the student in their English form, or their meaning may be translated if he desire to have them in a Sanskrit garb. %<spaüjaþ>% 'Sponge, '%<dyukaþ>%' Duke, '%<sàvanaü>%' Soap,' %<làñinaü>% 'Latinity' (as given by Mr. Borroah) may, I think, be very safely omitted even in a comprehensive Dictionary.

To turn now to the plan and arrangement of the work. The most striking feature of the arrangement is that a word in its different parts of speech, compound words derived from it, derivatives formed from it either regularly, by means of terminations (e. g. ed, ing, ly, ness &c.) or irregularly, have been given together, the derivatives being arranged in order under the root or primitive word, by means of small black dashes. The dashes are intended to at once strike the eye and to direct it to the word after it; and when the "directions to the student" are remembered, there, will, I believe, be no difficulty in referring words to the Dictionary. The principle of the arrangement is to give words according to the root-system; words regularly derived will, of course, be referred in their proper places; but words formed from the radical irregularly should also be referred under that radical. 'Abstemious.' should be referred under 'Abstain,' 'Perception' under, 'Perceive, 'Death,' 'Dead,' under 'Die,' 'Strength' &c., under 'Strong,' 'Would,' under 'Will,' and so on; where it is not likely for the student to know where such words are given, reference is made to those places; e. g. see Material, Sight. One of the greatest advantages of the system has been practically, (whatever it may be theoretically) to effect a very large saving of space. To give the reader an idea of the vast saving effected by this system, it may be stated that, if the words in their different parts of speech and their compounds and derivatives were separately given, as in Monier Williams' Dictionary, they would cover nearly 800 pages of this size, or 1, 000 of the size, style of printing, &c. of Monier Williams' Dictionary. Besides, by giving the words 'Dead' 'Death' under 'Die, 'a considerable repetition of words is avoided. About 20 equivalents are given for 'Die,' and only a few are given for 'Dead; the rest can be formed in the same way from the roots immediately above; if it were given in its usual place, all words would have to be given or a reference made to 'Die.' My chief aim has been to give a good deal of matter in a small space, and this object is, I believe, considerably secured, as shown by the figures given above; and I have thus been enabled to give this book to the public at a cheap price.

The next point to be noticed is the number of equivalents that are given for a word. I believe that in an English-Sanskrit Dictionary, it is sufficient to give such words only as are of very frequent occurrence in Sanskrit authors. It cannot include all words in the language, and even if it could, it would be of no great use, since many of the words would be found to be very rarely used. The word 'Gold' has over 50 synonyms given for it in the different lexicons; 'Sun' has nearly a hundred. But it will easily be seen that, excepting some, the synonyms are either combinations of simple words, or are descriptive epithets. Of this class are the words %<vakrapucchaþ lalajivhaþ ràtrijàgaraþ>% for 'Dog.' Mr. Borooah in his Dictionary has given only a few equivalents, in some in stances, only one, where there were 5 most commonly used; Prof. Williams has very often given too many equivalents, grouping together common and rare, synonyms proper and epithets. In the former case the student will hardly have any room left for choosing his word, while in the latter, he will be at a loss to see which to choose. In giving equivalents in this Dictionary, whether for Substantives, Adjectives, Adverbs or Verbs, I have endeavoured to strike a middle course between these two courses, and, have kept one principle steadily in view: to give such words as are found frequently used in the works of standard authors. The equivalents are arranged in the order of their frequency of use; and the students, in his ordinary prose composition, would do well to make his selection from the first few equivalents enumerated. In the case of Verbs it has not been possible to maintain this principle with perfect accaracy in every case, but it is generally maintained. It is only in a few cases of substantives that I have gone the length of giving all words enumerated in the Amarakosha; and in the case of names of material substances, names of plants and trees that have been identified, and in a few others, all the words given in the Amarakosha have been here incorporated. care being taken to arrange them in the order of their usefulness. Similarly such Genders, Padas or Conjugations are given as will be found generally used; I have very rarely given all possible ones. It has not been thought necessary to give the 3rd person singular, Present tense, nor all possible derivatives from simple words; they will have, if necessary, to be made up according to the "Directions" afterwards given. In giving equivalents for a word in its different senses, it has also not been thought necessary to give the meanings in English, except where it was necessary to note a particular sense. One word in Sanskrit often represents several meanings in English, and to render them into Sanskrit, the Sanskrit word has to be repeated. This accounts for the repetition of some Sanskrit words under different meanings.

In will be noticed that there are several sentences given to illustrate the meanings of words, some of which are quotations from standard authors, as will be readily seen from the references given after them; but many of the phrases and sentences that are translated, and are not supported by any authority, are taken from the "Student's Hand-Book of Progressive Exercises," Part II. I deemed it essential to illustrate, in some cases at least, the construction of the equivalents given, wherever it was peculiar in Sanskrit; and I thought I could do this better if I gave sentences from classical authors instead of framing them myself. The quotations have become quite necessary in those cases where equivalents have been here suggested for the first time; I thought I should produce my vouchers for a particular word that I suggested rather than leave the reader in doubt as to its genuineness. In a few cases the English or Sanskrit sentences are closely translated; in a few others only such parts of the Sanskrit sentences are translated as are sufficient to illustrate the word intended to be illustrated, while in several cases, Sanskrit sentences alone are given which might be readily understood by the student On a reference to the names of works or authors drawn upon for quotations, it will be found that the list is not very comprehensive; several large and useful works have been left out, and works falling in the range of classical literature excluded. But my principal aim in giving quotations has been to supply the student with good expressions from works within his easy reach so that he might study, if necessary. the particular places referred to. Kalidasa's works and Bana's Kadambari are more frequently drawn upon than the Ramayana, the Mahabhharata, the Naishadha or the Mahàviracharita.

An attempt has been made to avoid as much unneccessary repetition as was possible, without marring the usefulness of the work. A Dictionary is necessarily a work of repetition; several words have to be unavoidably repeated, howsoever unwilling one might be to do so. I have thought it necessary to make reference under some words to preceding or succeeding parts of the Dictionary, chiefly with the view of avoiding repetition; but in such cases a few equivalents are given, and the student is told to follow out the reference, if he want to know more about the word. Take, for instance, the words, Beguile, Cheat, Deceive, Delude, Defraud, Impose upon, Take in; or Blame, Censure, Reprove, Reproach, Scold, Reprimand, Reprehend; or Path, Road, Way: these words, whatever be their shades of meaning in English, are, when represented in Sanskrit, almost synonymous, and may be conveniently represented by the same words. If ten or fifteen equivalents under one of these words, say, Cheat. Censure, or Way, are given, it would be unnecessary to repeat all of them again under the synonymous words. In all such cases, therefore, references have been made to some general word under which are given all the equivalents. In a few cases the reference has been made, not for any equivalents, but for any expressions, phrases, idioms &c. that may have been given under the principal word. In no case will the student have to refer to the Dictionary more than twice.

In a work which professes to deal with the phrases and expressions of the English Language, the writer cannot afford to disregard the several small useful proverbs, mottoes, or other expressions which have become proverbial. I have, with this view, inserted, under some principal word therein, such proverbs &c., and have given exact or approximate equivalents, wherever they existed in Sanskrit, and have in a few cases given my own translation of them. Of this nature are proverbs given under Bush, Handsome, Make, Oil Race, Something, Suffer, Touch &c.

With regard to the method of writing the Sanskrit equivalents, an objection might possibly be raised. Throughout the work the usual practice of representing every anusvara in the body of a word by its corresponding nasals has been rejected and the anusvara sign is invariably used, where usually a nasal would stand. I have not been able to understand the principle on which scholars reject this system and betake themselves solely to the other; though the anusvara system is most convenient in printing, and occasionally saves much misunderstanding. Besides, it is a practice generally followed in our old Manuscripts, and is sanctioned by Panini as being optional. For these reasons I have scrupulously followed it in this Dictionary, but more especially because it is very convenient in printing. The rules of Sandhi, to make the words clearly intelligible, are not in all cases strictly observed.

It now remains for me to do the grateful duty of acknowledging my obligations to those that have assisted me in the preparation of the Dictionary in one form or another. Foremost among them stand the works of Mr. Borooah and Prof. Williams, both of which I have most frequently consulted. Monier Williams' Dictionary, though inferior in several respects to Mr. Borooah's, has several happy renderings of short words and expressions, especially where ideas, purely English, have to be clothed in a Sanskrit garb, and I have freely consulted his Dictionary for such renderings. I have also frequently referred to the learned Professor's valuable Sanskrit-English Dictionary; for both of which my sincere thanks are due to him. But my acknowledgments are chiefly due to Mr. Borooah, from whose work I have derived much substantial assistance, in the suggestion of equivalents for words or phrases, more particularly from his numerous quotations, and therein again, quotations from such works as were not accessible to me, or being accessible, I had no time at my disposal sufficient to go through them. I have also had to keep constantly by my side, the useful Sanskrit Lexicon-the Kosha of Amarasimha-made more useful by the edition published by the Department of Public Instruction, Bombay. In giving illustrative sentences from classical Authors, I have used annotations or translations wherever they existed, and have derived hints from them and have occasionally adopted their translation. My thanks are due to all annotators, editors or translators of such works. I have to thank' sincerely Prof. R. G. Bhandarkar, M. A. Deccan College, Poona, who kindly proposed suitable equivalents for some difficult words and phrases which were referred to him. I have also to thank my friend, Mr. Ganesh Krishna Garde. L. M. & S., for having supplied me with accurate equivalents for some knotty and technical terms in Medicine, from books and sources which I had no time to reach, and which even if I had time to reach and use, I could not, unaided by him, turn to much practical account. Lastly, my thanks are due to several kind and obliging friends who assisted me either in collecting materials for the Dictionary, or in carrying it through the Press.

In conclusion, I trust that the Dictionary will be useful not only to those for whose use it is principally prepared, but to the general public also who may wish to avail themselves of appliances calculated to help the study of Sanskrit. It is my belief that, except for the translation of passages from purely technical subjects, such as Chemistry, Botany, Medicine, Philosophy etc., this Dictionary will be useful to all readers of Sanskrit for translating any passage dealing with ordinary subjects. None is more conscious than myself of the defects of the book, and of the mistakes or inaccuracies that might have crept into it, in spite of my vigilance; and when a second edition is prepared, I shall endeavour, to the best of my ability, to make the Dictionary complete in itself. I shall be very happy to receive any suggestions that readers may have to make and shall be but too willing to adopt them, if I find them useful. With these prefatory remarks I leave the work to the indulgent judgment of the public.

PUBLISHER'S PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

The Publisher had hoped that the learned author would write a preface to this Edition; but unfortunately it was not to be. He was snatched away suddenly from amongst us by the cruel hand of death to the sincere regret of all lovers of Sanskrit learning. Therefore the present edition has had to suffer along with other works of his, the want of his finishing touch. However it is in some respects a consolation to think that Mr. Apte found time before his death to go carefully through the first Edition and to make the necessary corrections in it in the light of his riper studies.


DIRECTIONS TO THE STUDENT.
(TO BE STUDIED BEFORE USING THE DICTIONARY.)

1. Words and their derivatives are arranged in the following order: first the radical or primitive word, in all its different parts of speech; then compound words, arranged in alphabetical order; (in the case of verbs, such words as Break off, Turn out, are given as -off, -out); and then the derivatives which are always distinguished by a black dash; those formed regularly being given first, and the irregular ones, written fully, after them (see Ambition, Humble, Young.)

Note. -- This order is not regularly observed in the first three letters, compound words and derivatives being, in a few cases, both distinguished by black dashes.

2. In giving the terminations by which derivatives are formed, the changes which the final and initial letters undergo, e. g. the dropping. doubling or assimilation of letters are assumed; the terminations being always given in their original form; see Cut, Hurry, Mature.

3. (a) A small black dash (-) marks the commencement of a new derivative.
     (b) A word preceded by a large black dash (-) indicates that the derivatives given after it, are from that word and not from the radical or primitive word; see Die, Dead.
     (c) A hyphen used in the middle of Sanskrit words indicates that each of the members separated by the hyphen is to be repeated with the word after it; or that the word after the hyphen is to be taken as an alternative for the word immediately before it (to be, in some cases, decided by the context), e. g. in HAVE, l. 9, %<yathàkàmaü-svarucyà-vçt>% means %<yathàkàmaü vçt svarucyà vçt;>% in PRACTICE, l. 3, %<nityavçttiþ-caryà anuùñhànaü>% means %<nityavçttiþ nityacaryà nityànuùñhànaü>%.
     (d) A hyphen followed by a comma (-,) indicates that the word after it may stand by itself or may be joined with the word before it; e. g. in PLACE l. 1, %<pra- de÷aþ>% means the word is either %<de÷aþ>% or %<prade÷aþ;>%
     (e) A comma followed by a hyphen (,-) indicates that the word after it may be compounded with the word preceding it; e. g. in STAGE l. 1, %<raügaþ- ÷àlà>% means the word is either %<raügaþ>% or %<raüga÷àlà>%.
     (f)ø denotes that the word immediately before it which is separated by a comma, may be compounded with the words which it connects; e. g. #<PREVENT>#, l. 1 %<vç>% c.. %<ni-vini->% means the root is also %<nivç>% c. and %<vinivç>% c.

4. In the case of substantives, the nominative case, wherever it could at once indicate the gender, has been given; the visarga thus indicates masculine gender, and anusvàra neuter gender. Where the nominative is not indicative of the gender, it is given as m., f., n., as the case may be. All substantives ending in consonants have their genders specified as m., f., or n.

5. In the case of adjectives, the simple base only is given. The feminine of the majority of adjectives in %<a>% ends in, and adjectives ending in %<i u>% have generally the same base for all genders. In all such cases the simple base is given, the genders being formed regularly according to similar substantive bases. Irregular feminines are denoted in brackets. (f.) Bases ending in %<t n s>% form their feminine regularly in %<tã nã sã>%

6. (a) In the case of verbs, the Arabic figure denotes the conjugation to which the root belongs; Pdenoting Parasmaipada, #<A># Atmanepada, and U Ubhayapada (P & A.) Roots of the tenth conjugation belong to both Padas, theoretically at least; and hence 10 is used for all roots of this conjugation, though the Parasmaipada, unless where otherwise specified, should be generally preferred for use.
     (b) c. denotes causal, and is formed from roots by making the same changes as in the 10th conjugation. Wherever it cannot be formed by this general rule, it is shown in brackets.
     (e) D. means Denominatives; here the 3rd pers. singular Present tense is given throughout.

7. All the derivatives from a word are not always given when they may be easily supplied; more especially, in the case of potential passive participles, formed by %<tavya ya anãya>% past participles, present participles, verbal nouns, abstract nouns from adjectives, and adverbs from adjectives. Where there was any peculiarity in the formation of these derivatives, they are given; but in many cases the student will have to supply the forms, according to rules given in grammars.
