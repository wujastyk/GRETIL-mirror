THEODORE BENFEY



PREFACE.

FOR some years past there has been no Sanskrit Dictionary available for the English student. The second edition of that by Wilson, published in 1831, has been long exhausted, as also Yates' Abridgment, published in Calcutta in 1846. Dr. GoldstÅcker's excellent work has not yet reached the end of the first vowel, and the St. Petersburg Dictionary, by Messrs. Bîhtlingk and Roth, besides being in German, has only just completed the letter %<ph>%.

The present work aims at supplying this long-felt want. It does not exceed the limits of one volume, but at the same time it is hoped that it contains all that the student is likely to require. It especially includes all the words occurring in the different Chrestomathies and Selections generally in use (as Lassen's Anthology, my own Chrestomathy, Bopp's Nala, Johnson's Mah‡bh‡rata Selections, &c.), and in the texts usually read by students, as the Hitopade˜a, Pa§catantra, Manu's Laws, ¯akuntal‡, Vikramorva˜„, Uttarar‡macarita, M‡lat„m‡dhava, and MeghadÂta; but it is also believed to contain most of the words likely to occur in the general classical literature. It does not profess to contain the technical terms of the grammarians or philosophers, nor are purely Vaidik words included, except such as occur in the extracts given in the above-mentioned Chrestomathies.

References have been added to the greater part of the meanings, and sometimes explanations of passages also; but these latter are rarely introduced, for fear of swelling the volume beyond its proper size. For the same reason, compound words are generally printed in roman type, and arranged alphabctically under their last part. Thus the student must look for %<a-maÔgala, au-a¸˜a>%, and %<megha-dÂta>% respectively under %<maÔgala, a¸˜a>%, and %<dÂta>%. The difficulty arising from this source will soon disappear with practice. If a word. as for instance %<candra˜ekhara>%, is not found under %<c>%, its first component part %<candra>% will be found; and the student has only to turn to the letter %<˜>% to find the remaining part %<˜ekhara>%, and under it in its place the very word he is in search of.

For the same reason, feminies ending in %<‡, „, Â, ik‡>%, are inserted under the corresponding masculines (where there are such) in %<a, i, Á, n, nt, a§c, as, u, aka>%; while participles, participles used as substantives, and absolutives are inserted under the verbs to which they belong.

The etymology of every word is given, where ascertainable; but here also, to save space, abbreviations have been used. The several parts of a compound word are separated by hyphens, except in the case of the grammatical element, which is always preceded by + : thus, in p. 2, %<a-karuıa + tva>% denotes that this word is compounded of %<a>% and %<karuıa>%, with the affix %<tva>%; and similarly, in p. 397, %<d‡˜arathi>% is analysed as %<da˜aratha + i>%.

As Sanskrit is also of the greatest use in the study of Comparative Grammar, I have added at the end of the principal articles the kindred words in the Greek, Latin, and German (particularly the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon) languages.

I have availed myself of the valuable labours of my predecessors, especially the works, already mentioned, of Wilson, GoldstÅcker, Bîhtlingk, and Roth (as far as published), besides the ¯abdakalpadruma of R‡ja R‡dh‡k‡nta Deva, and the various glossaries which have been published for special books; but for the latter half some of there aids have failed me, and I have been chiefly left to my own resources. I must therefore crave the reader's indulgence for the deficiencies and shortcomings which he may discover.

I cannot close this Preface without expressing my sincere thanks to Mr. E. B. Cowell and Professor Max MÅller, for the assistance which they have rendered to me while carrying this work through the press.
