<composition.history>
The text of the Johnston edition was transliterated on the basis
of a cursory reading; the typed input was compared with the
edition by Cowell, partly as a routine of proof--reading, partly
in order to be able to add variant readings from the older
edition. (The conventions for inputting variants are described
below.) Proof--reading and insertion of variants was done
"manually" and I do not guarantee completeness. The additional
passages in Cowell at the beginning of the poem were not
transliterated completely, and the additional chapters at the end
were not transliterated at all.
<\composition.history>
 
 
<diacritical.marks>:
Punctuation marks are used to code diacritics. All diacritics are
typed in front of the letter to which they belong. This imitates
the traditional "layout" of typewriters where accents etc. are
placed on dead keys and need to be typed before the character is
typed.

. = subscript dot (e..g. k.rta.h)
; = superscript dot (e..g. a;nga)
? = tilda (superscript) (e..g. praj?n-a)
- = superscript hyphen (macron) (e..g. -atm-a)
/ or ' = aigu (superscript) (e..g. /s-astra, 's-astra)
! = da.n.da (or vertical bar)
 
This might be formalized according to the TEI guidelines (I am
not sure!!) as:
<grapheme code="-"diacritic="DL">
<grapheme code="."diacritic="DL"> etc.
In the TEI-Guidelines "&amacr;" (which makes current text
illegible) is used for my "-a".

Where, as in this introductory document or in comments to variant
readings within the text, the use of punctuation marks in their
proper function has to alternate with their function as
diacritical marks, their use as punctuation marks is
distinguished by a following blank (or numerals or other signs of
punctuation including parentheses, quotation marks etc.) or by
doubling where a blank is not possible (in abbreviations,
"e..g."). Thus, the dots in ".r.s.i" are diacritics, but the dot
after ".r.si. " is a full stop because of the following blank.
Similarly, since no blank can be inserted after a hyphen, the
actual hyphen is written by doubling it %("p-ada--index").
Exclamation mark is used for the da.n.da which serves as
punctuation mark in Devan-agar-i texts.
<\diacritical.marks>
 
<editorial.notes>
Annotations, remarks etc. by the editor of the transliteration
are enclosed in square brackets.

Annotations by the editor(s) of the edition which served as
source of the transliteration (e..g. conjectures, markers for
lacunae etc.) which are part of the printed edition are enclosed
in pointed parentheses.
<\editorial.notes>
 
<colophons>
Colophons which are part of the printed edition are enclosed by
double square brackets.

<analysis>
<sandhi>
The "principle of transliteration" has been that the input format
should reproduce the letters of the printed text as closely as
possible, i..e. that one types what one sees. However, markers
are added (in the transliteration) to what is printed (in
Devan-agar-i) to indicate that fact that a printed (and
consequently typed) letter has undergone some sandhi change.

   A sandhi change is defined with regard to the "pausa form" of
a word, i..e. the form a word would take at the end of a line or
out of context (vigraha). Note that this pausa form need not be
identical with the stem which would be entered in a dictionary.

   Thus, (final and initial) consonants which have undergone a
sandhi change in the text are marked by "*". Similarly, final
vowels which have changed due to sandhi are marked by "*" (e..g.
"-as-id* r-aj-a nalo* n-ama").

   In case of vowel sandhi the sandhi is dissolved and marked
(e..g. na*asti, ca*eva). Similarly, avagraha is reconstituted,
the originally omitted initial "a" being marked as sandhi vowel
(e..g. devo* *api).

   In some special cases the marking of sandhi has to be extended
to include some disambiguating information:

-- to half--vowels which substitute for a long vowel the
diacritic for "long vowel" (-) is added (e..g. devy-* api);

-- if final --a in sandhi does not stand for --a.h (with
visarga), then the original vowel which has been substituted by
the --a is added (e..g. lokae* eva, where "loka eva" is printed,
which is the sandhi form for "loke eva").
 
In case of "double sandhi" the sandhi is marked by double "**",
e..g. sa**eva in case of "saiva" instead of "sa* eva").
 
Blank is inserted between words wherever this is possible in
transliteration (though not necessarily in Devan-agar-i), e..g.
"hy* api", "nalo* *api".
<\sandhi>
 
<compounds>
Another feature which exceeds what might be expected from a
straightforward transliteration is the separation of nominal
compounds. Separation of compounds is marked by inserting +
between the members of a compound (e..g. brahma+pur-a.na,
buddha+carita). In case of sandhi, the + functions also as
sa.mdhi--marker, i..e. no additional sandhi--marker is added
(e..g. tapo+vane, mah-a+-atmana.h).
 
Separation of compounds is restricted to nominal compounds
(including upap-ada--compounds like ura+ga, go+p-i) and does not
include grammatical analysis. For details, special cases etc. see
the introduction to Sanskrit Indices and Text of the
Brahmapur-a.na, Wiesbaden 1987, p. xvi--xvii, by P. Schreiner and
R. S%hnen.
<\compounds>
 
<variae.lectiones>
<variants>
The beginning of the passage for which a variant exists is marked
by opening parenthesis. In deciding about the extension of the
text thus marked, the changes generated for the text format had
to be taken into consideration. This meant that occasionally
words which are identical in the base text and in the variant are
included in the parentheses, since in the text format (sa.mhita)
the beginning of a variant could not be printed if that word is
joined to the preceding word in vowel sandhi. Thus we write "...
(mah-a+-atm-a Xmah-a+puru.sa.h) ...", even though the "mah-a+" is
identical in both versions.
 
The beginning of the variant is marked by a siglum, viz. by a
single capital letter (capital letters are used exclusively for
that purpose in the transliteration). Several sigla are separated
by a comma (no blank) -- which does not occur in this file of
course. There is no blank between the siglum and the variant.
 
If there are several variants for the same passage of the base
text, they are listed sequentially. The variant (or the last
variant if there is more than one) is closed by the closing
parenthesis. The blank before the next word is considered to
belong to the variant and is put inside the parentheses. The
continuation of the base text follows without intermediate blank.
 
Schematic pattern:
(... A... )...
(... A,B... )...
(... A... B... )...
<\variants>
 
<interpolations>
Interpolations are treated as "variants without base text", i..e.
siglum follows immediately upon the opening parenthesis. The
siglum is repeated before the closing parenthesis which marks the
end of the interpolation. This allows for the input of variants
within interpolations which are attested in more than one source.
 
Long interpolations may be entered as a sequence of separate
interpolations (e..g. verse by verse). Interpolated lines are
(may be) marked by "X" at the beginning of the line (which is
meant to mark "star"--passages as e..g. in the criticial edition
of the MBh).
<\interpolations>
 
<omissions>
Passages from the base text which are omitted in any of the
variant texts are marked by double parentheses plus siglum
enclosing the omitted passage (which may also be individual
words).
 
Schematic patterns:
((S... S))
... ((S... S))...
<\omissions>
<\variae.lectiones>
<\analysis>
 
<reference.system>
The full reference (chapter and verse) is given at the end of the
verse to which it refers. (While transliterating the full
reference needs to be typed only for the first verse of each
chapter.) The reference consists of two figures separated by a
(single) dot. The first number refers to the chapter, the second
number refers to the verse--number within the chapter.
 
The beginning of references is marked by double exclamation mark
(i..e. da.n.da) and the end is marked by a single exclamation
mark. Always after a reference a new line begins.
 
<other.information>
The input and processing of the transliterated text has been done
with TUSTEP, the Tuebingen System of Text--Processing Programs.

   The TUSTEP format includes a reference number in front of
every record; this machine reference has been calculated in such
a way that it agrees with the textual reference. In the
ASCII--format of the input file this machine reference is lost.

    Some of the tools for textual analysis which can be produced
from the input format have been published for the Brahmapur-a.na:
Peter Schreiner, Renate Soehnen: Sanskrit Indices and Text of the
Brahmapur-a.na. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1987.
 
   The following list gives a survey of programs (German names in
parentheses) developed for the processing of our input:
 
   Any of the transliterated versions (i..e. ed. Johnston or ed.
Cowell) can be extracted (GRUNDTEXTKOP, VARTEXTKOP)
 
   The machine references in TUSTEP are calculated from the
references in the text (REFRECHNEN).
 
   The text format (i..e. the conventionally transliterated text
without markers; with compounds and sandhis reconstituted) can be
generated (TEXTFORM). This version can be processed for output in
Devan-agar-i with programs which work on the basis of
transliterated input (e..g. TeX).
 
   The pausa format of the text is generated by changing all the
characters marked by * or + according to the sandhi rules of
Sanskrit grammar. Each word appears in the phonetic form which it
would assume at the end of a line (e..g. -adibhir*, -adibhi.s*,
-adibhi's*, -adhibhis* all become -adibhi.h). Members of
compounds are separated. (PAUSAFORM)
 
Indexes:
-- KWIC--index (from modified input format)
-- P-ada--index (from modified text format)
-- wordforms (from pausa format)
-- reverse index of wordforms (from pausa format)

   All indexes are sorted according to the Devan-agar-i alphabet
and may include frequencies (absolute and relative) and
formatting commands for the output.
 
   Those interested in any version or output other than the
transliterated input format with variants may contact:

    Peter Schreiner, Indologisches Seminar, Universit%t Z%rich,
    R%mistr. 68, CH--8001 Z%rich, Switzerland.
 
I would appreciate if those who in using this electronic text
change it or add to it would inform me about their views and
intentions and methods and results; those who use this text for
their research while preparing a publication should feel morally
obliged to send me an offprint. (I hope I am not asking too
much!)
