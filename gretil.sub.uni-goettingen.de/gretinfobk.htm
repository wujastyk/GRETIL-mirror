       GRETIL is intended as a cumulative register of the numerous
       download sites 
       for electronic texts in Indian languages. 
       <BR><BR>
       
       GRETIL registers only e-texts that are freely available for
       scholarly 
       purposes and can be employed for word search etc. in a standard
       word 
       processing programme. In general, this excludes PDF files
       displaying text 
       in Devanagari or other Indian scripts, special formats for
       proprietary 
       software, as well as e-texts distributed for commercial profit.
       <BR><BR>
       
       Apart from registering electronic texts in Indian languages,
       GRETIL is 
       also intended to facilitate access to these texts. For this purpose
       all 
       registered e-texts are made available in the GRETIL Archives.
       <BR><BR>
       
       It should be noted that the archived files are intended <B>for
       reference 
       purposes only.</B><BR><BR>

       The texts provided in the GRETIL Archive have been converted
       from files 
       in various encodings. The details of these encodings are not
       always stated 
       in the respective source files, and in some cases references to a
       particular 
       encoding standard (e.g., &quot;ITRANS&quot;) have to be
       taken with some reservation. 
       In addition, some encodings may be ambivalent in their
       designation of 
       characters (assigning, e.g., &quot;n&quot; to various Sanskrit
       class nasals), or downright 
       obscure, thus denying the uninitiated access even for basic
       reference tasks.
       <BR><BR>
       
       In order to alleviate these and other problems, the GRETIL
       Archive 
       provides all available resources in three standardized formats.
       See 
       <A HREF="gretil/gretdiac.pdf"
       TARGET="_new"><B>CONCORDANCE</B></A> 
       and <A HREF="gretil/gretdias.pdf"
       TARGET="_new"><B>SYSTEMATIC LIST</B></A> 
       of GRETIL encodings and transliteration systems (PDF):
       
          <UL>
          <LI><B>REE</B></A><BR>
          This encoding was devised sometime in the 1980's by the
       late Ronald E. Emmerick, 
          Professor of Iranian Studies at Hamburg University, for
       WordPerfect 5.1 DOS 
          and related utility programmes BHELA, CARAKA etc.
       (DOS versions). 
          In memory of its esteemed author this encoding is here
       referred to as 
          &quot;<B>REE</B>&quot;.
       <BR>
          The choice of &quot;REE&quot; encoding may seem
       surprising, and it stands 
          to reason whether Ronald E. Emmerick would have
       approved of connecting 
          his name with an encoding that he probably considered
       long outdated. 
          Nonetheless, quite a number of indologists still use it.
       However, the 
          main reason for this choice was that, over the years, a
       variety of tools 
          had been developed for conversion from various
       encodings to REE.

          This encoding is based on two code lists first defined in
       1990 as &quot;CS&quot; 
          for the basic transliteration of Classical Sanskrit, and
       &quot;CSX&quot; for an 
          extended character set taking into account Vedic accents,
       Tamil etc.
       <BR>
          Unless stated otherwise, the minor additions and
       modifications to CSX, later codified in <B>CSX+</B>, 
          are inconsequential for the files available from the
       GRETIL CSX Archive.

          UTF-8 has been included as an additional archive format
       on 19.2.2003,
          although its use entails hardware and software
       requirements that 
          may not be considered necessary, or desirable, by
       everyone.
       <BR>
          All UTF-8 Archive files have &quot;Arial Unicode&quot;
       as standard 
          font setting. If you do not have this font (formerly
       available as 
          freeware and now included in office packages), please
       make sure 
          you have installed some other suitable Unicode font.
       <BR>
          You can load the GRETIL files in UTF-8 directly into
       your word processor, provided 
          it can handle Unicode.

       <BR>
       Unless stated otherwise in the files, Vedic accents were dropped
       in 
       order to facilitate basic word search. Otherwise the texts remain
       principally 
       unchanged, even though the sometimes peculiar conventions of
       transliteration, 
       especially when designed to emulate Devanagari, leave much
       room for further 
       standardization.

       <P>
       You can approach the search for a particular e-text from two
       angles:
       <BR>
       <UL>
       <P>
       <LI><B>Systematic search</B><BR>
       If you are looking for an e-text in a particular Indian language
       (e.g., Sanskrit) and / or 
       of a particular literary genre (e.g., Poetry), you can look up the
       language / 
       genre in the Index.
       <BR>
       For easier orientation, the Index is organized according to Moriz
       Winternitz's 
       &quot;History of Indian Literature&quot;. The archive of the
       Pali section 
       follows Oskar von Hin&uuml;ber's &quot;Handbook of Pali
       Literature&quot;. 
       The Tamil section follows Kamil V. Zvelebil's &quot;Lexicon of
       Tamil Literature&quot;.
       <BR><BR>
       You are recommended to start your systematic search from the 
       <A HREF="gretilbk.htm#Index" TARGET="_top">Index of the
       GRETIL homepage</A> 
       because the Index of an individual Archive (REE | CSX etc.)
       may not 
       register all e-texts available in all formats (e.g., Tamil texts are 
       not available in REE encoding; consequently, they are not
       included in 
       the Index to the REE Archive).
       
       <P><P>
       
       <LI><B>Alphabetic Search</B><BR>
       The GRETIL HTML pages are written in plain ASCII code
       without diacritics, 
       which makes the search for the name of a particular author /
       text very 
       easy: 
       <LI>Go to the top of the <A HREF="gretilbk.htm#Index"
       TARGET="_top">GRETIL homepage</A> 
       (or the respective Archive page),
       <LI>open the &quot;Search&quot; interface of your browser
       (usually by typing Ctrl-F),
       <LI>enter the name of the author / text.

       <B>INPUT OF E-TEXTS -- SOME
       SUGGESTIONS</B><BR>
       (formerly despatched on the INDOLOGY discussion list)<BR>
       <P>
       Here are some points that I have come to find useful in my own
       work as well as in preparing files from various sources for
       GRETIL.
       <BR>
       <UL>
          <LI> <B>Format</B><BR>
          Assuming that the aim of the text input is to provide a
          scholarly reference aid for a given text, rather than an
       exercise
          in piety, I consider transliteration in a PLAIN TEXT
       FILE
          preferable to any other format such as PDF, RTF,
       HTML etc.,
          which may turn out practically useless for the said
       purpose,
          especially when combined with non-Latin scripts.
       <P>
          <LI> <B>Encoding</B><BR>
          No matter which encoding is used in transliteration,
          it should be<BR>
          -  FREE FROM ANY AMBIGUITY (that may, e.g.,
       arise from employing
          &quot;n&quot; for different Sanskrit class nasals)<BR>
          -  and FULLY DOCUMENTED at the beginning of
       every e-text,
          preferably in a chart describing the character and/or
       giving the 
          equivalent &quot;ASCII&quot; number. No matter what
       may happen 
          to the e-text during the file transfer / download process, 
          the attached chart will suffer the same distortions -- and
       will thus 
          enable the reader on the receiving end to
       &quot;reconstruct&quot; 
          the encoding, if need be.
       <P>
          Here is an example of what such an encoding chart may
       look like:

        This is perhaps the most neglected aspect in
        the majority of e-texts one comes across. And yet,
       with the
        computer's well-known limitation to one screenful of
       text at a
        time, it is crucial to provide readers with adequate
       orientation,
        citing, as it were, book, chapter and verse in each and
       every
        screenful of text.
       <P>
               <UL>
        <LI>   REFERENCES SHOULD BE PLACED
       AT THE END of the respective
               text unit (such as a verse or line) to allow
       for later
               SORTING of lines (or padas) in
       alphabetical order
               (cf. below).
       <P>
        <LI>   REFERENCES SHOULD BE GIVEN IN
       FULL, e.g. &quot;3,13.120&quot;,
               instead of restricting them to the smallest
       unit, say, the
               verse number (just &quot;120&quot; instead
       of &quot;3,13.120&quot;). Having
               browsed two or three screens up or down
       from a chapter
               heading, one may easily have forgotten
       where exactly one
               happens to be. Orientation can be even more
       difficult if an
               ordinary word search takes you from the
       beginning of the
               file right to a verse with the enigmatic
       reference &quot;120&quot;:
               for a start, you will have to scroll 119 verses
       up to find
               out that you're in chapter 13, and it is all too
       plain that
               your expedition through the text - and away
       from the
               passage you were looking for - doesn't end
       there.
       <P>
        <LI>   With next to no additional effort, references
       can be made
               SUITABLE FOR CLASSIFIED SEARCH
       simply by using distinctive
               punctuation, such as COMMA between
       book and chapter, and
               DOT between chapter and verse. This
       allows you to
               distinguish the search for &quot;3,13&quot;
       (=book 3, chapter 13)
               from &quot;3.13&quot; (chapter 3, verse 13).
       <P>
        <LI>   Especially when a file contains more than
       one e-text, the
               reference should include an
       ABBREVIATION FOR THE TEXT in
               question, preferably with a connecting
       underscore to
               prevent accidental separation due to line
       break, e.g.
               &quot;MBh_3,13.120&quot;. Such an
       abbreviation is essential in pada /
               verse indices that you may later want to
       merge with indices
               of other texts to search for parallels.
       <P>
        <LI>   In a file combining a root text and
       interspersed
               commentary, say, the Mahabharata and
       Nilakantha's
               Bharatabhavadipa, distinct abbreviations,
       e.g.,
               &quot;MBh_3,13.120&quot; resp.
       &quot;MBhN_3,13.120&quot;, will facilitate
               orientation significantly.
       <P>
        <LI>   MARKERS FOR METRICAL UNITS
       (padas) AND SECTIONS OF PROSE
               (sentences) are indispensable for generating
       indices of padas, etc.
               For instance, the Anustubh pattern could
       look like this:<BR><BR>
               For a four-pada verse:<BR>
               ........  $ ........  &<BR>
               ........  % ........  // Name_n,n.n //<BR><BR>
               For a six-pada verse:<BR>
               ........  $ ........  &<BR>
               ........  % ........  \<BR>
               ........  # ........  // Name_n,n.n //<BR><BR>
               Here, again, everything is fine as long as it
       is
               UNAMBIGUOUS.
